👋 Hi there, I'm Yashasvi!
I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a huge passion for securing digital systems 💻. I'm currently a B.Tech student, and my main interest lies in the research and development of new cybersecurity solutions 🚀. When I'm not deep in code or vulnerability assessments, you can find me playing chess ♟️, designing posters on Canva 🎨, or getting lost in a drawing ✏️.
My studies have given me a strong foundation in network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment, and I'm comfortable with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Kali Linux. I'm always eager to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out!
